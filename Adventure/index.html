</p> When starting your trek to Disney, there are a few items you need to keep in mind and make sure you have at all times. First and foremost, do not forget to bring sunscreen. With the sun beating down on you in hot Orlando, it is very easy to burn. Especially do not forget if you have younger children! The next few items are a given, but can be easily forgotten. Don’t forget to bring your wallet, cell phone charger, and a water bottle. All of these items can be carried in a backpack throughout the parks.

Today we woke up bright and early and decided it was the best day to go to Animal Kingdom. Here are the top ten things you cannot miss at Disney’s Animal Kingdom; Festival of the Lion King. This is a musical stage show the movie “The Lion King”. The next best thing to do at the park is the ride Expedition Everst. It is my favorite ride, but you’ll have to test it to find out why. Kilimanjaro Safari is a top choice, along with the 3D animation: It’s Tough to Be a Bug. If you enjoy hiking, check out the Valley of Mo’ara or the Gorilla Falls Exploration Trail. All of these have great scenery, especially the Na’vi River Journey. The next few things you must check out are the TriceraTop Spin and the Dinosaur ride. These rides are great for smaller children. If you enjoy stimulation rides, check out the Avatar Flight of Passage.

When walking throughout the Disney Parks, it is important that you know what all of the terms and slang of Disney is. The basic is of course, WDW. This one stands for Walt Disney World. You may see that on certain websites or texts referring to the area. Today, someone told us to check you “Splash”. Now if you don’t know what Splash is, it means Splash Mountain. This is one of the rides at Disney. Make sure you also get a “Fast Pass” to help with the lines as they can get very long and you want to enjoy your time at the park. A Fast Pass is a pass that lets you ditch the lines.
